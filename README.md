# WAMutedBadges
Shows a badge that counts your messages since the last time you were actively inside WhatsApp

How this tweak works?

For example: You set group x as muted. you leave WhatsApp with 0 messages count, as soon as you have new message, you won't get an alert with the new message (regular WhatsApp behavior), only your icon badge will count the number of last messages you missed since you was actively inside WhatsApp (what the tweak does). the badge will disappear (and sets as 0 obviously) every time you get actively inside WhatsApp.

Tested on iOS 13, but should work on any version

Support latest version of WhatsApp but if that breaks, let me know!

No option to configure
